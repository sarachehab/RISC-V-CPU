# Extend Unit

The `Sign Extend` is fairly straigtforward for our RISCV as we need to extend the immediate of the based on the instruction type. 

The instructions are divided based on the following:

The following is how the different instruction types are extended based on the type of instruction (determined by the input `instr_i` given to the sign extend module from the controlunit)

```verilog
case(imm_src_i)

	//type I
	3'b000: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[31:20]};
	// type S
	3'b001: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[31:25], instr_i[11:7]};
	//type B
	3'b010: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[7], instr_i[30:25], instr_i[11:8], {1'b0}};
	//type Jal
	3'b011: imm_ext_o = {{12{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[19:12], instr_i[20], instr_i[30:21], {1'b0}};
	//type U
	3'b100: imm_ext_o = {instr_i[31:12], {12{1'b0}}};
	Â default: imm_ext_o = 32'b0;
```


The first test shown below outputted the correct `sign extended` immediate values for all except for imm_src_i = 11 which should set imm_ext_o to be { {12{1'b0}}, instr_i[31:12]};

Here, we can see that the instructions are sign extended properly
