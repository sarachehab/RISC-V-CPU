the sign extend is fairly straigtforward for our RISCKV31i as we need to extend the immediate of the based on the instruction type. 

the instructions are divided based on the following

note that as R type instructions dont have an immediate we do not need to sign extend any immediate for it.
 based on the instructions we extend the most signficant but of all instruction types expect Upper in which we set the instruction immediate as the most significant bits and concatenate it with 0's at the end.
the following is how the different instruction types are extended based on the type of instruction (determined by the input instr_i given to the sign extend module from the controlunit)

```verilog
case(imm_src_i)

	//type I
	3'b000: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[31:20]};
	// type S
	3'b001: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[31:25], instr_i[11:7]};
	//type B
	3'b010: imm_ext_o = {{20{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[7], instr_i[30:25], instr_i[11:8], {1'b0}};
	//type Jal
	3'b011: imm_ext_o = {{12{instr_i[31]}}, instr_i[19:12], instr_i[20], instr_i[30:21], {1'b0}};
	//type U
	3'b100: imm_ext_o = {instr_i[31:12], {12{1'b0}}};
	Â default: imm_ext_o = 32'b0;
```

here we can see that the instructions are sign extended properly
